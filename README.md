# Spam Mail Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying emails as spam or ham (not spam) using Logistic Regression. The project uses a dataset from Kaggle and aims to accurately identify spam emails to help filter unwanted messages.

## Project Overview

The project involves:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning to prepare text data for analysis.
- Feature extraction using `TfidfVectorizer` to convert email content into numerical features.
- Building a Logistic Regression model for spam classification.
- Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy metrics on the test set.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). It consists of labeled email data indicating whether each message is spam or ham. The data is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python packages:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
